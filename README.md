# Battler

An experimental CTB battler implementation using Elixir.

## Disclaimer

This is just a demo project and did in my spare time and by nature it's highly experimental. It's sole purpose is to demostrate the available techniques one can use to achieve a similar goal using Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView. Many bits in this project are not yet implemented (and may never be) and its left to the readers imagination to fill in the gaps, the code is made available as is. Here are some of the missing parts:

- Implement the enemy attacks
- Apply different effects for each skill
- Display skill effects in the UI
- Exit battle when one party defeats the other

## Running the project

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
